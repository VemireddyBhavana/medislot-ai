**Built for Hackathon Theme 6: Booking, Scheduling & Workforce**

## 🚨 The Problem
Clinics often manage appointments manually, leading to double bookings, unoptimized doctor workloads, high no-show rates, and overall inefficient appointment handling. Patients suffer from long wait times, and clinic staff burn out from unevenly distributed workloads.

## 💡 The Solution: MediSlot AI
MediSlot AI is a next-generation healthcare SaaS that eliminates manual scheduling inefficiencies through intelligent, automated workflows and live data integrations.

### ✨ Core Smart Features
- **🤖 AI Symptom Checker Chatbot**: Built with Google Gemini, patients can type their symptoms into the floating chatbot and receive immediate, AI-powered recommendations for the exact medical specialist they need to book.
- **🗺️ Live OpenStreetMap Integration**: Automatically pulls live, real-world hospital data (names, locations, contact info) within a 50km radius using the Overpass API, falling back to a local database to prevent rate-limiting.
- **⚡ Smart Slot Recommendations**: The booking engine dynamically suggests optimal appointment times to balance the daily load across available doctors, actively nudging patients toward the "Fastest Availability".
- **⚖️ Doctor Workload Balancer**: The Admin Dashboard proactively computes which doctors are overloaded and which are under-utilized, offering a live "Workload Distribution" widget to optimize clinic efficiency.
- **📱 Smart Reminders & Follow-ups**: An automated notification pipeline that generates immediate Booking Confirmations, schedules pre-visit Reminders (1-day before), and instantly fires off Follow-up re-engagement messages if a patient is marked as a "No-Show" or "Cancelled".
- **🚨 Priority Booking Triage**: Patients can select urgency levels (Routine, Follow-up, Urgent). Urgent appointments are visually highlighted on the live Admin Control Board in red for immediate staff attention.
